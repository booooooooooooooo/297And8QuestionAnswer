<!-- Instructions:

     1. Search and replace Your_Name with student's name
     2. Insert description at location Description_Here.
     3. Complete the Schedule of activities for 297 by for each week:
        (a) Replacing Calender_Week_i with the dates for that week.
            For example, Feb.1-7.
        (b) Replacing Read_And_Do_i with what will be accomplished that week.
     4. Five descriptions of each deliverable by replacing Deliverable_i
        with the description of that deliverable.
     5. Fill in a list of references according to the example in that section.

<p><b>Advisor:</b> Dr. Chris Pollett</p>

<p><b>Description:</b>
</p>

<p>
Given a passage and a question, the question answerer outputs an answer by choosing a subset of the passage. We will use a reading comprehension dataset SQuAD[1] in this project.
</p>

<p><b>Schedule:</b></p>

<table  border="1" cellpadding="4"
summary="This table has two columns. The left column indicates each
week on the semester in turn. The right column indicates the task
to be completed for that week."

<tr><td> Week 1 - 4:
 08/20 - 09/24</td><td valign="top"><b>Deliverable #1 </b>: Calculation of Back Propagation</td></tr>
<tr><td> Week 5 - 11:

<tr><td> Week 15 - 16:
12/04 - 12/17</td><td valign="top"> <b>Deliverable #5 </b>: CS297 report </td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Deliverables:</b></p>
<p> The full project will be done when CS298 is completed. The following will
be done by the end of CS297:</p>


<p>1.  Calculation of Back Propagation</p>
<p>2. Implementation of Word Embedding</p>
<p>3. Implementation of Preprocessing Data and Setting up environment</p>
<p>4. Implementation of match-LSTM in [2]</p>
<p>5. CS297 report.</p>
