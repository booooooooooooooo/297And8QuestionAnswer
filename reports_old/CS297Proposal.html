<p><b>Description:</b>
</p>

<p>
Question Answering(QA) is about making a computer program that could answer questions in natural language automatically. QA techniques are widely used among search engines, personal assistant applications on smart phones, voice control systems and a lot more other applications.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, more end-to-end neural network architectures are built to do question an- swering tasks. In contrast, traditional solutions use syntactic and semantic analyses and hand made features. End-to-end neural network approach wins on giving more accurate result. However, traditional ways are more explainable. The neural network approach is used in this project.
</p>
<p>
Among rich and varied question answering data sets, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD) is used in this project. It includes questions asked by crowd workers on Wikipedia articles. The
answer to each question is a segment of corresponding Wikipedia article[1]. In total, SQuAD contains 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles [1].
</p>
<p>
The goal of this project is to build a QA system on SQuAD using an existing end-to-end neural network architecture. If there is still time left after finishing the QA system, I will review related literatures and try to come up with an improved architecture.

<p> The full project will be done when CS298 is completed. The following will
be done by the end of CS297:</p>


<p>1.  Calculation of Back Propagation</p>
<p>2. Implementation of Word Embedding</p>
<p>3. Understanding Online Evaluation Environment and Setting Up Developing Environment</p>
<p>4. Implementation of paper [2]</p>
<p>5. CS297 report.</p>
